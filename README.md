A simple and easy to use tool designed to significantly lower your Amazon AWS
costs by automating the use of [spot](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot)
instances.

## How does it work? ##

When installed and enabled on an existing on-demand AutoScaling group,
AutoSpotting clones one of your on-demand instances from the group with a spot
instance that is cheaper, at least as large (automatically considering memory,
CPU cores and disk volumes) and configured identically to it. Once the new spot
instance is ready, it is attached to the group and an on-demand instance is
detached and terminated to keep the group at constant capacity.

It continuously applies this process across all enabled groups from all
regions gradually replacing your on-demand instances with much cheaper spot
instances. For your peace of mind, you can also configure it to keep running a
configurable number of on-demand instances given as percentage or absolute
number.

Your groups will then monitor and use these spot instances just like they would
do with your on-demand instances. They will automatically join your load
balancer and start receiving traffic once passing the health checks.

The installation takes just a few minutes and the existing groups can be enabled
and configured individually by using a few additional tags.

Read [here](TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md) for more information and implementation
details.

Frequently asked questions about the project are answered in the [FAQ](FAQ.md),
*please read this first before asking for support*.

If you have additional questions not covered there, they can be easily added to
the [crowdsourced source of the FAQ](https://etherpad.net/p/AutoSpotting_FAQ)
and we'll do our best to answer them either there or on Gitter.

## Getting Started ##

Just like in the above animation, it's as easy as launching a CloudFormation (or
[Terraform](https://github.com/cristim/autospotting/tree/master/terraform))
stack and setting the `spot-enabled` tag on the AutoScaling groups where you
want it enabled to `true`.

All the required infrastructure and configuration will be created automatically,
so you can get started as fast as possible.

For more detailed information you can read this [document](START.md)

[![Launch](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=AutoSpotting&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudprowess/nightly/template.json)

### Official binaries ###

The above stack can be used to conveniently install the latest build generated
automatically after each commit. Even though these builds are usually stable
enough, they may not have been thoroughly tested yet and come with no warranty
and only best effort community support.

They are distributed under a proprietary [license](BINARY_LICENSE) that allows
them to be used free of charge for a limited evaluation period, no longer than
14 days. Further use is possible but requires the payment of a monthly fee for
as long as you keep using them.

This fee should be at least 5% of the savings generated by the AutoSpotting
software, and it can be paid on a monthly basis through
[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?c=979085).

The license also forbids non-paying users to automate the installation of these
official builds on a recurring basis.

### Stable builds ###

Carefully tested builds are also available. They come with support from the
main author, who will do his best to help you configure and successfully run
AutoSpotting on your environment.

Your feature requests and issues will also be treated with higher priority.

These builds require a fee of at least 10% of the monthly savings, also paid
through [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?c=979085) on a monthly basis.

Please get in touch on [gitter](https://gitter.im/cristim) if you are interested
in getting access to the stable builds.

## Compiling and Installing ##

It is always recommended to use the stable binaries mentioned above. But if you
have some special needs or don't want to pay for long term use of the official
binaries, you can always build and run your customized binaries that you
maintain on your own, just keep in mind that those won't be supported in any
way.

More details are available [here](CUSTOM_BUILDS.md)

## Contributing ##

This project was developed by volunteers in their own spare time. If you find it
useful, please consider contributing to its development, any amount of help
would be greatly appreciated and would make a huge difference to the project.

The best way to help is by convincing your organization to use the official
binaries but other equally appreciated ways you can help are trying it out and
giving [feedback](https://gitter.im/cristim/autospotting), reporting bugs,
writing code, improving the documentation, assigning a developer to work on it,
or even just spreading the word.

Non-trivial code should be submitted according to the contribution
[guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

You can also contribute financially, we gladly accept recurrent tips on
[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?c=979085), regardless of the amount.

## Support ##

Community support is available on the
[gitter](https://gitter.im/cristim/autospotting) chat room on a best effort
basis, where the main authors and other users are likely to help you solve
issues with the official binaries.

The main author also offers enterprise-grade support and will do as much as
possible to help you out with any issues you may have, including with custom
feature development. For more information feel free to get in touch on
[gitter](https://gitter.im/cristim).
