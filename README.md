## AutoSpotting - Community Edition ##

Most new features, bug fixes and improvements for increased reliability and better performance developed by the main author after July 2022 are
only available in the commercial version of AutoSpotting, available on the AWS 
[Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-6uj4pruhgmun6). The only exception are security
fixes, which will be patched in the Community Edition on a best effort basis.

If you notice any issues in the Community Edition feel free to report them but they are not being worked on
by LeanerCloud anymore. Chances are they are already solved in the Commercial Edition, so you may want to 
try that out.

Bug fixes and new features contributed by the community are welcome and will
remain available in the Community Edition indefinitely.

The list of ehnancements in the Commercial edition is documented in detail 
[here](https://github.com/LeanerCloud/AutoSpotting/discussions/489), but you can see below a brief feature comparison of AutoSpotting options vs. AWS AutoScaling groups.

# About AutoSpotting


AutoSpotting is the leading open source spot market automation tool, optimized
towards quick/easy/frictionless adoption of EC2 Spot instances at any scale.

Since its launch in 2016, it's being used by thousands of users around the world,
companies of all shapes and sizes, in aggregate saved them in the 
hundreds of millions of dollars so far as per our current estimations.

It is usually set up to monitor existing long-running AutoScaling groups,
replacing their instances with Spot instances, with minimal configuration
changes.

Often all it needs is just tagging the AutoScaling groups with `spot-enabled=true`,
(in some cases even that can be avoided), yielding the usual 60%-90% Spot cost
savings but in a better integrated and easier to adopt way
than other alternative tools and solutions.

It is particularly useful if you have a large footprint that you want to migrate
to Spot quickly due to management pressure but with minimal effort and configuration
changes.

## Demo

Here's a demo of AutoSpotting and the way it integrates with the new [Spot Savings Estimator GUI](https://github.com/LeanerCloud/savings-estimator). (Click to open on YouTube)

[![Demo of AutoSpotting with the Savings Estimator](https://img.youtube.com/vi/VXfCOXXtLwA/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/VXfCOXXtLwA "AutoSpotting and Savings Estimator demo")

## Guiding principles ##

- Customer-focused, designed to maximize user benefits and reduce adoption friction
- Safe and secure, hosted in your AWS account and with minimal required set of IAM permissions
- Auditable OSS code base developed in the open
- Inexpensive, easy to install and supported builds offered through the AWS Marketplace,
with comprehensive support and additional features geared towards production usage at scale.
- Simple, minimalist implementation

## Benefits compared to alternatives ##

- automated failover to OnDemand instances in the event of lost Spot capacity
- automated instance type selection for Spot diversification without configuration changes from a standard OnDemand setup, and no vendor lock-in
- bias towards cheapest AND newest instance types

## How does it work? ##

Once installed and enabled to run against existing on-demand
AutoScaling groups, AutoSpotting gradually replaces their on-demand instances
with cheaper spot instances that are at least as large and identically
configured to the group's members, without changing the group launch
configuration in any way. You can also keep running a configurable number of
on-demand instances given as percentage or absolute number and it automatically
fails over to on-demand in case of spot instance terminations.

Going forward, as well as on any new ASGs that match the expected tags, any new
on-demand instances above the amount configured to be kept running will be immediately
replaced with spot clones within seconds of being launched.

If this fails temporarily due to insufficient spot capacity, AutoSpotting will
continuously attempt to replace them every few minutes until successful after
spot capacity becomes available again.

When launching Spot instances, the compatible instance types are chosen by
default using a the
[capacity-optimized-prioritized](https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-fleet-examples.html#ec2-fleet-config11)
allocation strategy, which is given a list of instance types sorted by price. This
configuration offers a good tradeoff between low cost and significantly reduced
interruption rates. The lowest-price allocation strategy is still available as a
configuration option.

A single installation can handle all enabled groups from an entire AWS account in
parallel across all available AWS regions, but it can be restricted to fewer
regions if desired in certain situations.

Your groups will then monitor and use these Spot instances just like they would
do with your on-demand instances. They will automatically join their respective
load balancer and start receiving traffic once passing the health checks, and
the traffic would automatically be drained on termination.

## What savings can I expect? ##

The savings it generates are in the 60-90% range usually seen when using spot
instances, but they may vary depending on region and instance type.

## What's under the hood? ##

The entire logic described above is implemented in a set of Lambda functions
deployed using CloudFormation or Terraform stacks that can be installed and
configured in just a few minutes.

The stack uses the minimal set of IAM permissions required for them to
work and requires no admin-like cross-account permissions. The entire code base
can be audited to see how these permissions are being used and even locked down
further if your audit discovers any issues. **This is not a SaaS**, there's no
component that calls home or reveals any details about your infrastructure.

The main Lambda function is written in the Go programming language and the code
is compiled as a static binary. As of August 2021 this has been included in a
Docker image used by the Lambda function.

The stack also consists of a few CloudWatch event triggers, that run the Lambda
function periodically and whenever it needs to take action against the enabled
groups. Between runs your group is entirely managed by AutoScaling (including
any scaling policies you may have) and load balancer health checks, that can
trigger instance launches or replacements using the original on-demand launch
configuration.

details.

## FAQs ##

Many Frequently Asked Questions about the project are answered in the
[FAQ](https://autospotting.io/faq), *please read this first before
asking for support*.

If you have additional questions not covered there, reach out to us on 
[Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/leanercloud/shared_invite/zt-xodcoi9j-1IcxNozXx1OW0gh_N08sjg)
and we're happy to help.

## Getting Started ##

It's usually as easy as launching a CloudFormation (or
[Terraform](https://github.com/AutoSpotting/terraform-aws-autospotting)) stack
and setting the (configurable) `spot-enabled` tag on the AutoScaling groups
where you want it enabled to `true`.

When installed from the AWS
[marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-6uj4pruhgmun6), all
the required infrastructure and configuration will be created automatically, so
you can get started as fast as possible. Otherwise you'll need to build it
yourself as per the instructions available [here](CUSTOM_BUILDS.md).

For more detailed information on how to get started you can also read this
[document](START.md)

## Support ##

Marketplace subscribers can get support on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/leanercloud/shared_invite/zt-xodcoi9j-1IcxNozXx1OW0gh_N08sjg)
and any feature requests or issues raised via this communication channel
will be prioritized.

Community support is available to OSS users on the
[gitter](https://gitter.im/cristim/autospotting) chat room, where the main
authors and other users are likely to help you solve issues. This is offered on
a best effort basis and under certain conditions, such as using the latest
version of the software available on the main Github branch, without any code
customizations and using the default configuration options.

If you need help for a large scale rollout or migrating from alternative
tools/solutions get in touch on [gitter](https://gitter.im/cristim).
