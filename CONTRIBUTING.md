# Contribution guidelines #

[![Chat on Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/cristim/autospotting.svg)](https://gitter.im/cristim/autospotting?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)

The usual GitHub contribution model applies, but if you would like to [raise an
issue](https://github.com/cristim/autospotting/issues/new) or start working on a
[pull request](https://github.com/cristim/autospotting/pulls), please get in
touch on [gitter](https://gitter.im/cristim/autospotting) to discuss it first so
we make sure everything is clear and that nobody else is already working on it.

Any random questions are also better asked there.

## Feature requests ##

The use case should be presented in detail in the issue, and should also
be discussed on gitter to make sure nothing was lost in translation.

## Bug reports ##

Bug reports should contain enough details to be reproduced by a developer.

The commonly required information is already pre-filled when creating any GitHub
issue, but be prepared to provide more when asked, either in the issue comments
or on gitter.

## Pull requests ##

Pull requests will need to pass code review by the project maintainers before
they can be merged, in order to ensure the high quality of the software and the
maintainability of the codebase.

As part of the review process the maintainers will often just verify that the
patch meets the requirements listed in the pull request checklist, but they may
also suggest other improvements they think may be appropriate.

Be prepared to iterate your pull request until it is ready to be approved. This
may take a while for bigger contributions, don't be discouraged if this may take
longer than you initially expected.

You can submit iterations as additional commits to make the review process
easier, but the reviewer may be squash them into a single big commit at merge
time, in order to clean up the mainline commit history.
